We are excited to announce that we have centralized our common PR checklist items across all repositories in the organization. 
These checklists are now available in our organization-wide GitHub templates. You can find the templates here: [org wide GitHub templates](https://github.com/octanner/.github/blob/main/docs/) 

> Feel free to make any suggestions or improvements to these global templates.  
> PR is always welcome!

This effort aims to streamline the PR review process and ensure consistency across all projects. If needed, you can override these checklists by creating a new file in your own repository.  
For more information, please refer to: [Creating a default community health file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).  

Thank you for your cooperation and happy coding!
